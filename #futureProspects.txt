💡 Unique Selling Points (Make It Worthy!)
1️⃣Comparison Mode - Visualize 2 algorithms side-by-side (e.g., Bubble Sort vs. Quick Sort).

2️⃣ser-Generated Data - Let users input their array (e.g., CSV/randomize).

📌 Avoiding "Directionless" Feeling
Phase Your Work

Phase 1: Finish all Sorting/Searching algorithms (2 weeks).

Phase 2: Add Sliding Window/Two Pointers (1 week).

Phase 3: Polish UI/UX (1 week).

Focus on Quality

A few well-animated, documented algorithms > 50 rushed ones.
